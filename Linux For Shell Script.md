     ```
     - **Explanation**:
       - `-h`: Displays memory usage in a human-readable format (e.g., MB, GB).

3. **`grep`**:
   - **Description**: Used to search for specific patterns within text files or outputs.

     SOMEVAR="text stuff I am learning"
     echo "$SOMEVAR"
     ```
     - **Explanation**:
       - `SOMEVAR="text stuff I am learning"`: Assigns the value to the variable `SOMEVAR`.
       - `echo "$SOMEVAR"`: Prints the value of `SOMEVAR`.
   - **Common Use**: Storing and reusing values in scripts.

8. **Executing Shell Scripts**:
   - **Description**: You can execute a shell script using `sh` or by marking it as executable.
