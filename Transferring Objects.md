Working with `scp` and `rsync` to transfer files and directories between your local machine and remote servers, specifically AWS EC2 instances.

### ssh command

```bash
ssh -i key.pem ubuntu@ec2-54-205-203-204.compute-1.amazonaws.com
```

### 1. Copying a File from Local to Remote Machine

```bash
scp -i "key.pem" /home/ubuntu/Local-Dir-path/Local-file... ubuntu@ec2-public-ip.compute-1.amazonaws.com:/home/ubuntu/Remote-Dir
```

**Explanation:**

- **`scp`**: Secure copy command used to transfer files securely over SSH.
- **`-i "key.pem"`**: Specifies the SSH private key (`key.pem`) for authentication.
- **`/home/ubuntu/Local-Dir-Path/local-File`**: The local file path you want to copy.
- **`ubuntu@ec2-public-ip.compute-1.amazonaws.com`**: The remote server's username and address.
- **`:/home/ubuntu/Remote-Dir`**: The destination directory on the remote server.

**Purpose:**

This command copies the `Local-file` file from your local machine to the `/home/ubuntu/Remote-Dir` directory on the remote EC2 instance.

---

### 2. Copying a Directory Recursively from Local to Remote Machine

```bash
scp -i "key.pem" -r /home/ubuntu/Local-Dir-Path/Local-Folder... ubuntu@ec2-Public-IP.compute-1.amazonaws.com:/home/ubuntu/Remote-Dir
```

**Explanation:**

- **`-r`**: Recursively copy entire directories.
- The rest of the command is similar to the first one but targets a directory instead of a single file.

**Purpose:**

This command copies the entire `Local-Folder...` directory from your local machine to the `/home/ubuntu/Remote-Dir` directory on the remote server.

### 3. Copying a Directory Recursively from Remote to Local Machine

```bash
scp -i "key.pem" -r ubuntu@ec2-100-26-239-213.compute-1.amazonaws.com:/home/ubuntu/Remote-Dir /home/ubuntu/local-Dir-Path/
```

**Explanation:**

- **`ubuntu@ec2-...:/home/ubuntu/Remote-Dir`**: Specifies the remote directory you want to copy.
- **`/home/ubuntu/local-Dir-Path/`**: The destination directory on your local machine.

**Purpose:**

This command copies the `Remote-Dir` directory from the remote server to the `/home/ubuntu/local-Dir-Folder/` directory on your local machine.

---

### 4. Synchronizing Local and Remote Directories Using `rsync`

```bash
rsync -e "ssh -i key.pem" -avz /home/ubuntu/local-Dir-Path/ ubuntu@ec2-3-15-221-86.us-east-2.compute.amazonaws.com:/home/ubuntu/Remote-Dir-Path
```

**Explanation:**

- **`rsync`**: A utility for efficiently transferring and synchronizing files across computer systems.
- **`-e "ssh -i key.pem"`**: Specifies the remote shell to use (`ssh` with the `key.pem` for authentication).
- **`-a`**: Archive mode (preserves permissions, symbolic links, etc.).
- **`-v`**: Verbose output (shows detailed information during transfer).
- **`-z`**: Compress file data during the transfer.
- **`/home/ubuntu/folder-in-local`**: The local directory you want to synchronize.
- **`ubuntu@ec2-...:/home/ubuntu/folder-in-remote`**: The destination directory on the remote server.

**Purpose:**

This command synchronizes the `folder-in-local` directory from your local machine with the `folder-in-remote` directory on the remote server. It only transfers the differences between the two directories, making it efficient for large or frequently updated datasets.

## Additional Tips and Best Practices

- **Ensure Correct Permissions on `key.pem`**:

  Before using the SSH key, set the correct permissions to secure it:

  ```bash
  chmod 400 key.pem
  ```

- **Use Absolute Paths**:

  When specifying file and directory paths, use absolute paths to avoid confusion.

- **Verbose and Progress Indicators**:

  For `rsync`, you can add `--progress` to monitor the transfer progress:

  ```bash
  rsync -e "ssh -i key.pem" -avz --progress folder-in-local ubuntu@ec2-...:/home/ubuntu/folder-in-remote
  ```

- **Dry Run with `rsync`**:

  To see what changes would be made without actually transferring files, use the `--dry-run` option:

  ```bash
  rsync -e "ssh -i key.pem" -avz --dry-run folder-in-local ubuntu@ec2-...:/home/ubuntu/folder-in-remote
  ```

- **Excluding Files with `rsync`**:

  You can exclude certain files or directories:

  ```bash
  rsync -e "ssh -i key.pem" -avz --exclude 'node_modules' folder-in-local ubuntu@ec2-...:/home/ubuntu/folder-in-remote
  ```

---

## Troubleshooting Common Issues

- **Permission Denied Errors**:

  - Ensure the SSH key (`key.pem`) has the correct permissions (`chmod 400 key.pem`).
  - Verify that you're using the correct username (`ubuntu` for Ubuntu EC2 instances).

- **SSH Connection Issues**:

  - Check if the EC2 instance is running and accessible.
  - Ensure that the security group associated with the EC2 instance allows inbound SSH connections (port 22) from your IP address.

- **Host Key Verification Failed**:

  - If you receive a host key verification error, the remote server's SSH key may have changed. You can remove the old key from your `~/.ssh/known_hosts` file:

    ```bash
    ssh-keygen -R ec2-100-26-239-213.compute-1.amazonaws.com
    ```

## Summary

- Use `scp` for simple, straightforward file transfers.
- Use `rsync` for efficient synchronization, especially for large directories or when transferring only changes.
- Always ensure your SSH keys are securely stored and have appropriate permissions.
- Double-check your commands before execution to prevent accidental data loss.
